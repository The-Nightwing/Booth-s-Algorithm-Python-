I have Implemented Booth's Algorithm in Python.
It is considered that we are using only integers(not floating point numbers).

Functions Used:
    converttoBinary:
        It calls two functions.if number is positive it will call positive num ele twoscompliment
    positivenum(n)
        It converts the positive number given by converttoBinary function in its binary form.
    twoscompliment(n)
        It converts the negative number to its equivalent twoscompliment form because that is how we represent negative numbers.
    shiftToRight(n)
        It is for right shifting of the binary number passed to it.
    adding(n):
        It is for addition of two binary numbers passed to it.
    binaryToDecimal(n):
        If the answer is coming to be positive binaryToDecimal will give the result, else it will call the btoD function.
    btoD(n):
        It is for converting the decimal into binary if the answer coming is to be negative.
    Booth(b1,b2):
        This is where the algorithm took place.
    main():
        Main Function of the program.
